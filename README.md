# Big Data Churn Prediction with Spark

+ This project involves developing a machine learning classification model to predict customer churn, evaluating the model's performance, and visualizing the results. By doing so, we aim to gain valuable insights to support business decisions.

+ To predict customer behavior, we will use one of the PySpark machine learning packages called **_GBTClassifier_**.
